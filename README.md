You need to have java 17.0.2 2022-01-18 LTS
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 17.0.2+8-LTS-86)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 17.0.2+8-LTS-86, mixed mode. to run the file.
As git is not working properly i have to upload the zip file of my project.
Another thing i did it on console. As i work on Apache netbeans 12.6 and have downloaded
the MSSQL 19. I did not find any proper jar file(library) to connect them so i have to do 
it in console. The jar file i got for netbeans 8.0 and for 8.0 i could not find the 
JDK file.
